Added JSPs and Servlets to help with grabbing values when clicking the edit link. Price and Description can be edited but code can't be yet and needs to be looked at. If anyone can jump in on it and took a look that'd be great.
Still don't have a confirm and delete page.
We need to get add product button to work still as well so when you click it all fields are blank and then whatever is typed is added to the list of products.
Fields in add product button start off null for now. Which I think I know why it is an easy fix. Will be back it later today to try and finish up what I can.
